The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Graph (KANG) model is a neural network architecture that builds upon the concept of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), but with the key addition of the ability to leverage the structure of knowledge graphs. KANG places learnable activation functions on the edges of the network and incorporates relation property constraints, enabling it to capture complex, compositional function representations more efficiently and facilitate interpretable collaboration with human experts for scientific discovery tasks. The KANG framework is designed to tackle a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks, from knowledge graph completion and question answering to complex reasoning and decision-making.
